# Bamazon


## Tools 

Node, MySQL, JavaSript, jQuery, Inquirer.

## How it works

User command line prompts are written using Inquirer and the MySQL queries update store inventory quantities. This application provided practice in writing MySQL queries, and creating a Node command line application.

You can access the app as a Customer, a Manager or a Supervisor.

Download or Clone and then from root directory:

npm install

then

node bamazonCustomer.js

or

node bamazonManager.js

or

node 

bamazonSupervisor.js
